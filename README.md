# Ambari Client
A python client to interact with Apache Ambari API.

If you intend to use a interactive python session,
I recommend running the following before starting the session.

```bash
export PYTHONSTARTUP="./ambari_env.py"
```

This will run the commands in ```ambari_env.py``` upon initializing the session.
It works for both python and ipython for versions 2.5+ and 3.0+
